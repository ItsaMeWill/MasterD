# Videojogos-MasterD

Here I will share my evolution while participating in the 2d game development course, using the Unity engine, developed by the Master D school, in Portugal
Since i've spent my entire life playing, it was always my dream to be able to work with game development.
I really believe that working with what we love, should be a life goal, so, this is my first step into that!
